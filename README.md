# HTML-select-option
Gathering more easily stylable replacements for the Select option on an HTML form, because the default one is really annoying!
The aim is to have a few really good, responsive/cross browser/other buzz-words ready select form elements
to be dropped into a web form that needs some styling (so we don't have to fight the default).

I've removed all the fancy bits to get down to a skeleton that can be used for future projects.
